In the above application students had be tasked to create a application which would show information of different historical figures in regards to a age entered in the app. When looking that the applications Graphic User Interface you can expect to see 3 labels, 2 buttons and 1 edittext. The labels are what would be used to indicate a heading, display a result which will information about the historical figures and a basic label indicating where the user would have to enter the number of there choose, the label contain id's called txtHead,txtEnter, and txtNumber respetively. The buttoms play an important role in the application. One of the buttons called btnClick is responsable the clear text on txtNumber and the edittext when the application is running so that the user could enter different inputs in the desicnated range (20-100). The next button called btnNumber is responsable to create a link between the edittext and the label txtNumber to process the input of the number that was entered in the application and then output the information on the label txtNumber. The last compound the edittext called edtNumber is used for users to enter numbers (ages) into for the application to process and generate an output to display.

Looking upon the code for the application you would intially see imports and code related to the main activity. The first piece of code i had add where my declarations for my labels, buttons and edittext. [val txtNumber = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.txtNumber)] this how i would create access from the code to the labels in this case its label txtNumber which shares the same name(id) in the coding process which I could change as long as i state the correct id of the label. I would use val as Im only asigning a value to the txtNumber in the code which is findViewById which is what I use to find the id of the label and make it equal to txtNumber next i would indicate what field(property) of the label I would need which is TextView which would be used so that the label will display an output in result of what i code further on in the program. Lastly I uses (R.id.txtNumber) just to indicate which of the three labels im going to use by stating the id of the label im going to use, I would repeat the process for all three labels. For my buttons i do something similar but change TextView to button because i expect the process of the button and i would change the varables name and change the id to btnNumber , how i did it [val btnNumber = findViewById<Button>(R.id.btnNumber)]. For my edittext i would codee it the exact same way as did text but change the varables name and change the id, as to way its the same is for the program to read what is entered into the editext [val edtNumber = findViewById<TextView>(R.id.edtNumber)]. Next i would create simple code which would display as so as the application runs. I had created code which effects the display of the labels txtHead and txtNumber, by calling out the .text feature i would be able to change what is displayed by the to a new phrase or changing the text to display nothing/clear the text indicate as follows: [txtHead.text = "Welcome to the History app" & txtNumber.text = ""]. Next i would start code for my button btnClick which i would say[ btnClick?.setOnClickListener] i would code this so that when the user clicks this button the code that falls under this would display when the application is running. Under this command i would create new code, [ txtNumber.text = "" & edtNumber.text = ""] by coding this both the label txtNumber and edittext edtNumber would clear any text which it contained before clicking the button so that the user could enter different inputs and get different outputs. Now i would start coding for btnNumber [btnNumber?.setOnClickListener] so that i can began the process of displaying outputs based on what is inputed into the application. Now i would start the process of using if statements to display differnet outputs, in my my code i have add historical figures such as Nelson Mandela, william Shakespear, Martan Lurthur king, Chuck Norres, Beyonce, Leonardo da Vinci, Vincent Willem, Abraham Lincoln, Albert Einstien, and Timothy Cook.[if (edtNumber.text.toString().toInt() <= 20)] coding this if statement indicates that im using the edittexts text function but in order to conpair text to a number(20) i would have to and the function toString.toInt for the edittext to be read and compair to number the if statement requires it be compaired to which is 20 in this string of code. if the statement is true the label will then display text which indicated for it to rely which is [txtNumber.text = " There are not historical figures in the 20's year old range enter again"] but if the statement is false it enters a new if statement because of the use of a elseif statement but now its not 20 its 30 [elseif (edtNumber.text.toString().toInt() <= 30)] if statement is true user will be displayed with a message related to Martin Luthur King [txtNumber.text = "Martin Luther King Jr., a prominent American leader of the civil rights movement and Nobel Peace Prize winner" + ", was shot and killed at the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968, at the age of 39"] all information is in refference to wikipedia on pages which presents information about the idividual. if statement false the same process occurs but the  number increase from 30-35-40-50-55-60-65-70-80-95-100 and a message from one of the histrical figures will apear in txtNumber text. Although if the number is equal to or greater than 100 [if (100 >= edtNumber.text.toString().toInt())] then a message stating that you are out of range will display on txtNumber text [txtNumber.text = "number out of age range enter a different number"]. 

When the application runs the user will be prompted to enter a age in a editext and for example 95 then user would have to click the buttom which indicates click on it, a brief set of information related to Nelson Mandala would diplay and if the user would like to enter a differrent number the user would have to click the button which says clear on it and the user could then enter a new age with out Mandela's info show below if you would like to look at code there are screenshots atatched to the files and application is in the master branch.
